# engine-crane
A tool to put engines created in Automation into Assetto Corsa.

It is a stand-alone program that takes data from a combination of:
 - a BeamNG mod exported from Automation (the car is irrelevant - just the engine data is used at the moment)
 - the simulated engine data that is generated by Automation and shown to you when you're in the engine designer

It generates the following data:
 - an N/A wheel torque-curve in the power.lut based on some assumed drivetrain losses. Currently it bases the mechanical efficiency on the drive-type of the AC though in future I plan to make it configurable.
 - If a turbo is used for the engine then it will generate a turbo section and accompanying turbo controller file to match the boost@RPM values from Automation as closely as it can
 - A coast torque value based on the friction values of the engine in the BeamNG mod
 - The inertia of the engine; again taken from the BeamNG mod
 - fuel consumption based of the of the efficiency data of the engine. You can either specify a AC vanilla physics fuel consumption calculation (which is not very accurate) or it can generate a lut for the more accurate CSP extended physics fuel calculations (details here)
 - If the existing cars engine weight is known then it will update the car weight based on the difference between the old and new engine weights
 - It updates the auto-shifter based on the RPM of the new engine and if it can find shift leds in the target AC car it will update those to the new engine RPM
 - It generates a new set of UI data for the car based of the new engine
