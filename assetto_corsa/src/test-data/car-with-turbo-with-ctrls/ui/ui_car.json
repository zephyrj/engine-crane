	"description": "
This example ui entry is used for testing purposes. It is derived from the Porsche 911 Turbo S AC car: with a 3.8-litre, twinturbo six-cylinder engine that has even larger turbochargers than the 911 Turbo. Developing 427 kW (580 hp), the maximum torque is 750 Nm. You accelerate from 0 to 100 kmh in a breathtaking 2.9 seconds. And reach 200 kmh in 9.9 seconds. Top speed: 330 kmh.
<br><br>
From a technical point of view, the 911 Turbo S is just as well equipped as the 911 Turbo. In terms of performance, however, the specification is even more elaborate.
<br><br>
Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) provides active roll stabilisation and enhances the neutral handling further. The Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) improves braking performance. New 20-inch 911 Turbo S wheels have a central locking device â€“ technology derived directly from motor racing.
<br><br>
The design of the 911 Turbo S is accentuated in a number of ways: on the outside, tailpipe trim in black chrome and SportDesign exterior mirrors with their V-shaped base
